abstract: >
  Phyling is a fast, scalable, and user-friendly tool supporting phylogenomic reconstruction of species phylogenies directly from
  protein-encoded genomic data. It identifies orthologous genes by searching a sample's protein sequences against a Hidden Markov
  Models marker set, containing single-copy orthologs, retrieved from the BUSCO database. In the final step, users can choose
  between consensus and concatenation strategies to construct the species tree from the aligned orthologs.


  Phyling efficiently resolves large phylogenies by optimizing memory usage and data processing. Its checkpoint system enables
  users to incrementally add or remove samples without repeating the entire search process. For analyses involving closely related
  taxa, Phyling supports the use of nucleotide coding sequences, which may capture phylogenetic signals missed by protein
  sequences. The benchmark results show that Phyling substantially runs faster than OrthoFinder, a Reciprocal Best Hit based
  method, while achieving equal or better accuracy.
